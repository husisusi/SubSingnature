# SubSignature

SubSignature is a lightweight, self-hosted email signature generator built with PHP and SQLite. It was designed to help organizations manage and standardize email signatures without relying on complex database setups or paid cloud services.

The primary focus of this project is privacy and security. The application runs entirely offline within your server environment, meaning no external requests to CDNs (like Cloudflare or Google Fonts) are made by the client. All assets are hosted locally.

## Installation

1.  Upload the files to your web server.
2.  Ensure the `private_data` folder is located one level above your public web directory (for security reasons) and is writable by the web server.
3.  Navigate to `install.php` in your browser to initialize the SQLite database and create your admin account.
4.  Delete `install.php` after the setup is complete.

## Credits & Third-Party Assets

This project makes use of excellent open-source libraries and resources:

* **Jodit Editor:** The template creation interface is powered by the Jodit WYSIWYG editor. It provides a clean and powerful interface for editing HTML directly in the browser.
* **Free Icons:** User interface icons are provided by FontAwesome (Free tier), hosted locally to ensure privacy compliance.
